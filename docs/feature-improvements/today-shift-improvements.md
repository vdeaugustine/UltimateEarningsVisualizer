# Today Shift Feature Improvements

## Current Implementation Overview

The Today Shift feature is a core component of the UltimateEarningsVisualizer app that allows users to track their real-time earnings during an active work shift. The feature includes:

### Key Components
1. **TodayShift Core Data Entity**: Temporary shift object that tracks start/end times and manages allocations
2. **TodayViewModel**: Singleton view model that manages real-time calculations and state
3. **NewTodayView**: Main view container that shows different states based on shift status
4. **Real-time Tracking**: Updates earnings every second using a timer
5. **Payoff Queue System**: Automatically allocates earnings to expenses and goals based on user-defined priorities
6. **Time Blocks**: Allows breaking shifts into segments for detailed tracking
7. **Tax Calculations**: Includes federal and state tax deductions in real-time calculations

### Current User Flow
1. User taps on Today tab
2. If no shift exists, shows "YouHaveNoShiftView" with "Add Shift" button
3. User sets start/end times in SelectHours sheet
4. During shift, sees real-time earnings with progress bar and allocation details
5. When shift ends, banner appears with "Save" button
6. ConfirmTodayShift view allows reviewing/editing allocations
7. Saving converts TodayShift to permanent Shift with Allocations

### Data Architecture
- TodayShift is temporary and expires at end of day
- Uses TempTodayPayoff structs for real-time allocation calculations
- Converts to permanent Shift and Allocation entities when saved
- Maintains payoff queue order through comma-separated UUID strings

## Identified Pain Points and Limitations

### 1. User Experience Issues

#### **Shift Creation Flow**
- **Problem**: Multiple taps required to start a shift (Today tab → Add Shift → Set Hours → Save)
- **Impact**: Friction for users who start shifts frequently
- **Evidence**: Complex navigation path through NavManager and multiple sheets

#### **No Quick Start Options**
- **Problem**: No way to quickly start a shift "now" without selecting times
- **Impact**: Users working flexible hours need to manually set current time
- **Evidence**: SelectHours requires explicit time selection even for immediate starts

#### **Limited Shift Templates**
- **Problem**: Only shows last 4 shifts and regular schedule, no custom templates
- **Impact**: Users with varying schedules can't save common shift patterns
- **Evidence**: SelectHours.swift lines 60-73 show limited recent shifts

#### **Confusing Save Flow**
- **Problem**: Banner dismissal vs actual save action is unclear
- **Impact**: Users might dismiss banner thinking shift is saved
- **Evidence**: TodayViewModel has separate `saveBannerWasDismissed` and save logic

### 2. Real-time Tracking Limitations

#### **No Pause/Resume Functionality**
- **Problem**: Can't pause shift for breaks or interruptions
- **Impact**: Inaccurate earnings for users who take unpaid breaks
- **Evidence**: No pause-related methods in TodayShift or TodayViewModel

#### **Fixed End Time**
- **Problem**: Can't extend shift duration while in progress
- **Impact**: Users working overtime must delete and recreate shift
- **Evidence**: End time is set at creation and not editable during shift

#### **Limited Time Block Creation**
- **Problem**: Time blocks can only be added, not edited or removed during shift
- **Impact**: Mistakes in time block creation can't be corrected
- **Evidence**: TodayViewItemizedBlocks only has add functionality

### 3. Allocation System Issues

#### **Rigid Queue Processing**
- **Problem**: Allocations strictly follow queue order with no smart prioritization
- **Impact**: High-priority items might not get funded if large items are first
- **Evidence**: payOfPayoffItems function processes items sequentially

#### **No Partial Allocation Options**
- **Problem**: Can't allocate specific percentages or amounts to items
- **Impact**: Users can't customize how earnings are distributed
- **Evidence**: TempTodayPayoff only tracks sequential filling

#### **Tax Calculation Limitations**
- **Problem**: Taxes are calculated but not clearly integrated into the allocation flow
- **Impact**: Users may be confused about after-tax earnings vs allocations
- **Evidence**: Tax calculations in view model but separate from main allocation logic

### 4. Data Persistence Issues

#### **Loss of Unsaved Shifts**
- **Problem**: TodayShift expires at end of day, potentially losing data
- **Impact**: Forgotten shifts are permanently lost
- **Evidence**: ExtendTodayShift.swift line 20 sets expiration to endOfDay

#### **No Draft/Auto-save**
- **Problem**: No intermediate saving of shift progress
- **Impact**: App crashes or errors could lose hours of tracking
- **Evidence**: Shift only saves when explicitly confirmed

### 5. UI/UX Inconsistencies

#### **Information Overload**
- **Problem**: Too many numbers and sections visible at once
- **Impact**: Users overwhelmed by dense information display
- **Evidence**: TodayViewInfoRects shows 6 different monetary values

#### **Unclear Visual Hierarchy**
- **Problem**: All information presented with similar visual weight
- **Impact**: Hard to quickly see most important information
- **Evidence**: Multiple sections with similar styling in MainView_TodayView

#### **Limited Customization**
- **Problem**: Can't hide/show different sections based on preferences
- **Impact**: Users see irrelevant information (e.g., goals when none exist)
- **Evidence**: All sections always visible regardless of content
